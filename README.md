# 🏥 Medical SQL Project

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the practical application of SQL to analyze medical datasets and answer real-world business and operational questions. It focuses on transforming raw healthcare data into meaningful insights through structured querying and relational database concepts.

The primary objective of the project is to strengthen SQL proficiency, including data exploration, table relationships, and analytical querying using healthcare-related data.

## 📁 Project Structure
- data/ – Contains CSV files used to create database tables
- sql/ – Includes SQL queries designed to answer specific analytical questions
- report/ – Holds the detailed project report prepared in Microsoft Word

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of structured medical data covering:
- Patient information
- Doctor details
- Hospital admissions
- Location and facility data
These datasets are loaded into a relational database to establish table relationships and support analytical querying.

## 🧠 SQL Analysis
Each SQL query is written to address a specific business or analytical question
Queries utilize:
  - JOINs to connect related tables
  - WHERE clauses for filtering
  - Aggregations and calculations for insights
- Emphasis is placed on query accuracy, readability, and logical structure.

## 🛠 Tools Used
SQL – Querying and data analysis
CSV Files – Source data for database tables.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Understanding and modeling relationships between multiple tables
- Writing efficient and logically correct SQL queries
- Ensuring data accuracy while working with relational data

# ✅ Summary
- This project highlights the ability to:
- Work with relational medical datasets
- Write structured SQL queries to extract insights
- Apply joins, filters, and aggregations effectively
It reflects foundational SQL skills and problem-solving ability expected in data analyst and database-oriented roles.
